    Despite the promised salvation you thought you would earn by passing the
    test of imagination, no help comes. You continue struggling to grip the
    tree, until your exhausted muscles finally give out. You are free falling!
    To keep from panicking, you begin to count. 1, 2, 3…
    Somewhere between 8 and 9 you are knocked out by a blow to the head.

    You’re in a dream within a dream. You’re a spirit, or a ghost, or something.
    You’re in somebody’s house but they can’t see you. You’re observing a
    little girl. She runs out to the curb to get the mail for her mother.
    Opening the rusty mailbox, she gasps, for inside is the most amazing piece
    of mail anyone has ever seen! Iridescent, pearly purple paper was shaped
    as a three-dimensional flower with a tiny figure perched on top. No little
    girl, least of all this one, could believe a piece of mail like that could
    be possible. Overcome with excitement, she runs into the house, sneaks past
    her mother, and carefully closes her bedroom door behind her.

    Alas, her mother calls her to the kitchen before she can open the card—-
    or whatever it is! Now, you’re pretty wrapped up in this little drama and
    have quite forgotten about your fall from the tree and the fact that you’re
    a ghost. You watch as Kyla sulks at the kitchen sink. She’s trying to get the
    dishes done as quickly as possible so she can find out what’s in that amazing
    letter.

    In her emotional and hurried state, Kyla fumbles while washing a teacup
    that had belonged to her great grandmother. The teacup springs from her hands
    and as Kyla lunges to catch it, she slips and falls, spraining her wrist. The
    teacup meanwhile hurtles into the kitchen window where it smashes gloriously
    into smithereens.

    While Kyla’s mother fusses as she bustles the child into the car for an
    unplanned trip to the hospital, you float around the house. Curiosity leads
    you straight through Kyla’s bedroom wall. You use your all-seeing ghost eyes
    to read the magical mail addressed to Kyla. Inside the sculptural card was an
    invitation written in glowing gold ink. It read, “You are formally invited
    to a Tea Party presented by the Fairy of the Tall Tall Tree.”

    Suddenly you remember your fall. You feel the impact to your head as if it
    were happening again. But strangely, your head doesn’t hurt. You open your
    eyes to find yourself in a hospital bed. Your wrist is throbbing. There is a
    knock on the door and you expect a nurse or doctor is coming to look after
    you. But it is that dastardly fairy from the tree instead. She sets up a tea
    table right next to the hospital bed, and pours herself a cup of tea.

    The fairy directs her piercing eyes straight into your soul. When she speaks,
    her words sound chillingly familiar:
